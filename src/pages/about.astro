      <p>
        Biomedical Engineering graduate from Universitas Gadjah Mada turned into AI & Data Engineer. As Biomedical Engineering graduate, I learned a lot of electrical engineering and computer science stuff when I was an undergraduate student such as electrical circuit, networking & data communication, linear algebra, discrete math, algorithm & data structure, microcontroller, etc. 
        So I have fundamental knowledges in programming both in software and hardware but not expert as CS and EE students.

        As my internship before was as AI engineer @ Kalbe, I have experiences in solving real-world problems using AI/ML such as in corporate healthcare domain while
        currently working as data engineer for sales and marketing stuff.
