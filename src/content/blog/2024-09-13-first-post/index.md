As this is my first post, I want to tell you that I remake & redesign my personal website from Vite + React with similar project structure as Astro into Astro with Shadcn UI (React) components library and Tailwind CSS.

I also redesign my personal website into neobrutalism UI style as i love this style even though not everyone like it (personal preference). Now i migrate my website techstack into Astro rather than Vite + React because Astro match my preference to build my website rather than React through Vite. At first, i want to remake it using NextJS but i think Astro is a better fit for me at this moment as more content-friendly framework and suitable for personal website building.

I feel like i over-engineer my own personal website by using specific ui design and adding stuff that not really need to be there (actually). But as I'm having fun myself, i will keep updating my personal website code and make my code and web clearer in the future.

Thats all for my first post. This blog page still under development as i will add more stuff or reengineer it again. Maybe this is it for my first post.
