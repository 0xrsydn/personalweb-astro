As this is my first post, I want to tell you that I remake redesign my personal website from Vite + React with similar project structure as Astro into Astro with Shadcn UI component library and Tailwind CSS.

I also redesign my personal website into neobrutalism UI style as i love this style even though not everyone like it (personal preference). Now i migrate my website techstack into Astro rather than Vite + React because Astro match my preference to build my website rather than React through Vite. At first, i want to remake it using NextJS but i think Astro is a better fit for me at this moment.

Thats all for my first post. This blog page still under development and maybe I'll delete this post later ðŸ˜¹
