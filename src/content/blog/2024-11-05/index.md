Current AI tools i use for prototyping and production-grade level app development (yep, full brainrot setup):

- [Cursor](https://www.cursor.com/) as default IDE for AI-pair programming
- [v0](https://v0.dev) to generate/modify UI component, pretty UI prototyping
- [Bolt](https://bolt.new) as fullstack app prototyping tool, might be used for prod-grade level app
- [Claude](https://claude.ai/new) for coding assistant in general (still best LLM for coding/app development for me) also it's API key
- [Aider](https://github.com/Aider-AI/aider), AI pair programming in terminal (rarely use it)
- [OpenHands](https://github.com/All-Hands-AI/OpenHands), software development agent, open source version of Devin (rarely use it, bit buggy)
- [Replit](https://replit.com/) (optional, Bolt replacement)

This fullstack app development with almost 80-99% AI-generated slop itself works really well on web development, specifically front-end side (no-brainer, frontend could be fully generated by LLM itself). The downside of this setup itself is nonconsistent coding style and mess code that need to be cleaned and reorganized to be maintainable & readable. 

For example, code generated by AI might be full written in a single file while it's better to be modularized (per sub problem, feature, etc.) for easier maintainability. AI-generated code also make unnecessary garbage code that doesnt need to be generated and make a lot of mistakes most of the time. So, at the end, to make our code production ready, we might have to do endless debugging at the end (using AI ofcourse lmao). 

Also the cost of using LLM API and the tools subscription cost itself might be downside (Cursor, Claude, Replit, v0 monthly subscription cost is $20/month) even though you can abuse the free limits. 

At the end, AI-generated code is great as boilerplate of app development rather than end to end fullstack app development. It also reduce so much time for shipping app such as app that need **2 weeks** to develop could be developed within **20 minutes**.

# Playbook

### A. Prototyping First
![Example of Bolt usage](/images/blog/bolt-example.png)
1. Make a prototype directly on bolt.new (the website one)
2. Revise and improve it till limit or looking good (vibe based)
3. From bolt web, export the repo to github, clone the repo, do the debug and more improvisation > eval repeat on cursor untill production grade level. You can deploy straight from bolt web using Netlify.
### B. Cursor Composer Setup

1. Make whole detailed well-written ~~novel~~ prompt as text or markdown put it as .cursorrules on new repo. [Here](https://github.com/PatrickJS/awesome-cursorrules) is the list of cursorrules.
2. Instruct to develop app through cursor composer
3. Loop of generate > try > debug > eval > improvement cycle
### C. UI Improvement with v0
![Example of v0 usage](/images/blog/v0-example-2.png)
UI improvement could be achieved using v0 as UIUX and component prototyping also can be used for making and styling component too. Works really well for frontend side especially React + NextJS + Tailwind CSS setup.
### D. Straight to Production

Well, you can straight develop production-grade level app that **works** less than a hour especially if your app is really simple. What i mean by simple is app such as snake game, coin flip (head/tail), word counting app, color palette generator, etc. Give detailed and structured prompts to Bolt or Replit (I would recommend Replit for this) and straight deploy the app if it's work fine.
