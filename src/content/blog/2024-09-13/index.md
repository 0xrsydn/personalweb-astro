As this is my first post, I want to share that I've been rewriting and redesigning my personal website. I've transitioned from using Vite + React with a similar project structure to Astro, incorporating Shadcn UI (React) components library and Tailwind CSS.

I have also redesigned my personal website with a *neobrutalism* style. I love this style, even though it might not be everyone's cup of tea (it's a personal preference). I have migrated my website's tech stack from Vite + React to Astro because Astro better aligns with my preferences for building my website. Initially, I considered remaking it using NextJS, but I believe Astro is a better fit for me at this moment as it's a more content-friendly framework and more suitable for building personal websites.

I feel like I might be over-engineering my own personal website by using a specific UI design and adding features that aren't strictly necessary. However, since I'm enjoying the process, I plan to continue updating my personal website's code and making both my code and the website clearer in the future.

That's all for my first post. This blog page is still under development, as I will be adding more content and possibly re-engineering it again. I suppose this concludes my first post.
